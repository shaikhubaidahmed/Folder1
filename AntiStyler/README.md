## 🚀 Overview

Adversarial patch attacks can severely degrade object detection (OD) performance by inserting localized, malicious patterns into images.

**AntiStyler** is a **fast, training-free, and fully agnostic defense** that:

- 🧠 Detects adversarial patches via “style inconsistency”
- 🎭 Removes adversarial “random style” using a modified style transfer process
- 🎯 Masks suspicious regions with minimal impact on benign images
- ⚡ Runs in real-time (~10–12 FPS)

Unlike many prior defenses, AntiStyler:
- ✅ Does **not require retraining**
- ✅ Is **model-, patch-, and attack-agnostic**
- ✅ Preserves **benign performance**
- ✅ Works on **both digital and physical attacks**

## 🖼️ AntiStyler Pipeline

![Pipeline](AntiStyler%20pipeline.png)

AntiStyler consists of **four sequential phases**:

### (A) Style Removal
- Apply **random padding** to ensure the presence of “random style”
- Use a modified style transfer model (**AntiStyle**) to remove style
- Output: *AntiStyled image*

### (B) Filter Phase
- Compute **absolute difference** between original and AntiStyled image  
- Extract pixels with the largest changes → **raw mask**

### (C) Enhancement Phase
Apply morphological operations:
- Dilation → connect regions  
- Erosion → remove noise  
- Smoothing + thresholding → refine mask  

### (D) Mask Phase
- Apply mask to input image  
- Output: **defended image** → fed to detector

## 🔬 Method Intuition

AntiStyler is based on a key observation:

> Adversarial patches introduce **high-frequency, random “style” patterns** that differ from natural image statistics.

Instead of reconstructing images, AntiStyler:
1. Removes style (not content) using a modified loss:
   - Minimize content loss  
   - **Maximize style loss**
2. Regions that change the most → likely adversarial
3. These regions are **masked instead of reconstructed**

This avoids:
- Object misalignment  
- Localization errors  
- Heavy computation
